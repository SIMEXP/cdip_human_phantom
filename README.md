Here is a brief description of each item in the repository:

**Matlab Scripts**

* **niak_pipeline_t1_average.m** - Octave script averaging T1w images of a subject iteratively with linear registration inside a NIAK container.

* **Csub_t1_average_all_scans_final.m** - Octave script that calls niak_pipeline_t1_average.m and provides needed information.

* **Csub_preprocess_all_scans.m** - Octave script to run a preprocessing pipeline analysis on CDIP data inside a NIAK container.

* **HNU1_preprocess_sll_scans.m** - Octave script to run a preprocessing pipeline analysis on HNU1 data inside a NIAK container.

* **connectome_Csub.m** - Octave script to run a connectome pipeline on preprocessed fMRI data to generate connectivity maps.

* **connectome_HNU1.m** - Octave script to run a connectome pipeline on preprocessed fMRI data to generate connectivity maps.

* **all_correlations_Csub.m** - Octave script to assess consistancy between connectivity generated by connectome for Csub dataset

* **all_correlations_HNU1.m** - Octave script to assess consistency between connectivity generated by connectome for HNU1 dataset 

**Notebooks**

* **graphs.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook that contains graphs for Csub intra-site, inter-scan consistency over time (2.5 years), Csub vendor consistency and HNU intra-individual consistency per network, and across all networks

* **stats_repro.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook used for generating the statistics used to assess the consistency of individual rsfMRI measures within/between sites

* **stats_fingerprinting.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook used to assess the ability of a simple data-driven cluster analysis to recover the identity of subjects based on connectivity maps of a single network

* **Csub-intra_png** - images used for average connectivity maps

* **Csub_correlation.csv** - spreadsheet with correlations for intra-site and inter-scan consistency

* **HNU1_Csub.csv** -spreadsheet with all correlations between HNU1 and Csub datasets


**Dashboard**

* **HNU1_and_Csub_dashboard** - dashboard that shows consistency findings from many subjects (N=26) scanned 10 times over the course of 27 days

* **Csub_longitudinal_consistency_dashboard** - dashboard that shows the consistency of brain connectivity maps generated using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) across 17 visits of a single individual


**Dockerfile** - defines the executable environment used for binder container
